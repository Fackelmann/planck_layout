# Emacs optimized planck layout

My layout for the Planck keyboard. My goal is to optimize the ergonomics using emacs. You can see that clearly in the positioning of the CTRL keys, easily accesible with the thumbs.

This is still a work in progress, although at this point my goal is to make incremental optimizations.
